# Azure Managed Identity 20201215

A common challenge for enterprises is the management of secrets and credentials to secure communication between different services. On Azure, managed identities eliminate the need for developers having to manage credentials by providing an identity for the Azure resource in Azure AD and using it to obtain Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tokens.

Enabling managed identities on Azure resources enables access to be granted to other Azure Resources through Role Based Access Control, for example, a managed identity can be enabled on an Azure Logic App and that identity be granted access to Azure Key Vault to obtain credentials via the [[http-action-202012151712]] which supports Managed Identity authentication, creating an easy and highly secure way to access Azure Resources.

Managed Identities can also be granted access to any Azure AD backed APIs, for example, a managed identity can be enabled on an Azure Logic App and that identity be granted the Sites.ReadWrite.All application role to SharePoint Online and be used with the [[http-action-202012151712]] action which supports Managed Identity authentication to call SharePoint APIs using [[app-only-authentication-202012151637]], creating an easy and highly secure way to access Azure AD backed APIs.

As the responsibility for managing the credentials used by the managed identities are with the Azure platform, credentials are automatically rolled every forty-five days without the need for any intervention from Operations teams.
