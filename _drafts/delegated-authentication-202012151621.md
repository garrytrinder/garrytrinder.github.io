# Delegated Authentication 202012151621

Delegated authentication is used as the default way for workflow engines such as Logic Apps to authenticate with services, whilst this is the simplest method of authentication it requires the use of a user identity, what can be termed a 'service account'.

This service account is generally highly privileged and is used by non-privileged accounts to carry out actions on behalf of them or to operate background processes that end users do not interact with.

In Microsoft 365, it is worth noting that when using delegated authentication for running background processes, the requests made by this user are limited by the per-user resource usage limits and so in high usage scenarios can be more prone to [[throttling-202012151623]] than using [[app-only-authentication-202012151637]] where requests are not made within the context of a user.
