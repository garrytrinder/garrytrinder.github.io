# Throttling 202012151623

Throttling is best described in the guidance from Microsoft in the page titled, ‘Avoid getting throttled or blocked in SharePoint Online’, which states.

> SharePoint Online uses throttling to maintain optimal performance and reliability of the SharePoint Online service. Throttling limits the number of user actions or concurrent calls (by script or code) to prevent overuse of resources.
> That said, it is rare for a user to get throttled in SharePoint Online. The service is robust, and it is designed to handle high volume. If you do get throttled, 99% of the time it is because of custom code. That doesn't mean that there aren't other ways to get throttled, just that they're less common. For example, you spin up 10 machines and have a sync client going on all 10. On each sync 1 TB of content. This would likely get you throttled.

When using delegated authentication, the requests are sent as being made by licensed user, which can be prone to throttling due to the per-user resource usage limits that are placed on each user to maintain optimal performance and reliability of the SharePoint Online service.
