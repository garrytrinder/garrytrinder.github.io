# Trigger Concurrency Setting 202012081009

All triggers in Azure Logic Apps have a concurrency setting that can be configured to restrict the number of parallel executions. 

By default, the concurrency control setting is turned off, allowing for an unlimited number of parallel runs to be executed, however this can cause downstream services to become overloaded if they cannot cope with the demand in high usage scenarios.

To reduce the load on downstream services, the concurrency setting can be configured to execute a defined number of parallel instances, ranging from a minimum of one, up to a maximum of fifty.

When a trigger has the concurrency setting enabled, if it receives more triggers than the concurrency setting allows, the [[logic-app-executions-are-queued-202012081017]]. 

Drawbacks of enabling concurrency is discussed in [[drawback of using concurrency control in Logic App triggers 202012081257]].
