# Turning off auto save in Power Apps App Studio

By default, the App Studio is set to always save every two minutes, whilst this is good to save your work regularly this can sometimes be an issue.

When making large changes to an app or make some experimental changes, I don't want it to be saving every two minutes, effectively saving a broken app if I am mid-change which makes it harder to rollback.

You can turn off the autosave

`https://uk.create.powerapps.com/studio/` -> Account -> Auto Save -> Off
