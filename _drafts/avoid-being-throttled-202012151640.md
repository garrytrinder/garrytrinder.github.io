# Avoid Being Throttled 202012151640

Whilst throttling was seen during the investigations, it was not always the major reason behind failures of the service, however it is good practice to work within the guidance to prevent throttling as it ensures that when making requests to SharePoint Online, they are performed in the most efficient way possible.

The guidance states

 - Reduce the number of operations per request
 - Reduce the frequency of calls
 - [[decorate-your-traffic-202012151641]] so we know who you are
 - Leverage the [[retry-after-http-header-202012151643]]

Although not stated, as requests made using [[delegated-authentication-202012151621]] are affected by the per-user resource limits, it is also recommended to use app-only authentication instead.
