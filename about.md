I am a Microsoft Certified Professional specialising in SharePoint and Office 365, based in Barnsley, UK. 

Currently working for [CPS](https://www.cps.co.uk "Corporate Project Solutions"), a multi award winning Microsoft Gold Partner based in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, as an Solutions Architect, specialising in Integration and Automation.

In January 2020, I received the Microsoft [Most Valuable Professional](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5003609) (MVP) for Office Development.

In April 2020, I officially [joined](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/blogs/new-microsoft-365-patterns-and-practices-pnp-team-model-with-new-community-leads/) the Microsoft 365 Patterns and Practices (PnP) team through my contributions to the community and helping to lead the [Office 365 CLI](https://pnp.github.io/office365-cli/) project as a project maintainer.

I am also a co-organiser of the [PowerPlatform User Group](https://www.meetup.com/PowerPlatform-User-Group-Leeds/) held in Leeds, which meets bi-monthly to discuss the latest announcements of features across Microsoft 365.
