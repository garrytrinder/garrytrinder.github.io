## OFSTED Power Automate Replacement

Replaced Get Summary, Get Evidence and Get Evaluation Flows with direct Dataverse connections
Data is being returned but when being looped no data is being pulled into the local collections due to naming changes, as formulas use @ based selectors no errors are thrown
These will need to be updated to use the new property names when being mapped to local collections
