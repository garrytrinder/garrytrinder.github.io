Microsoft Inspire 2022, the annual partner conference takes place virtually between 19-20 July. 

Here are three sessions that caught my eye whilst looking through the session schedule that I think will be of interest to those who are already, or are thinking about, building solutions on the Microsoft 365 platform.

## 1️⃣ 🧘 [Bring all your essential apps, tools, and processes into the flow of work](https://inspire.microsoft.com/sessions/09d8f152-b485-4ad7-bc71-5a2dc03eb70b?WT.mc_id=m365-71151-garrytrinder)

🗣 [Navjot Khalsa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/navjotkhalsa/)

> The Collaborative Apps solution play will help customers improve the flow of work with integrated Teams apps built by Microsoft, ISVs, and SI partners or built by their own organization—all in one place.

## 2️⃣ 💰 [Create New Revenue Streams with Teams apps](https://inspire.microsoft.com/sessions/c2a742bb-87d5-48c5-abf2-c04a4e6928f2?WT.mc_id=m365-71151-garrytrinder)

🗣 [Alvaro Celis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alcelis/) and [Gloria Sánchez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glosanchez/)

> Customers are evolving to hybrid models quickly where Teams is the new front-end for hybrid work. With over 270M monthly active users, Teams offers the biggest opportunity for partners to reach new audiences and segments globally. Join us to learn the business opportunities that Modern Work offers and hear best practices from other partners. The Teams platform can help both your business and your customer’s business thrive.

## 3️⃣ 🎓 [Viva Learning APIs public preview: How to leverage these connectors](https://inspire.microsoft.com/sessions/406000ae-f3ce-4ba0-aa20-0c5d51ac6451?WT.mc_id=m365-71151-garrytrinder)

🗣 [Andrea Lum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lumandrea/), [Divyanka Malik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/divyanka-malik/) & [Malabika Roy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/malabika-roy-b3774015/)

> Viva Learning Content Sync APIs are now available in public preview. In this session we’ll review what the APIs are, how they work, and what’s next for Viva Learning extensibility. We’ll also discuss how to utilize these APIs to onboard more customers to Viva Learning, as well as partnership and monetization opportunities for Systems Integrators and Learning Solution providers.
