A good friend sent me a link to a video one evening, the video just so happened to be one of the most watched TED Talks of all time, currently racking up a cool 38M views and it was a revelation.

Following watching this video, I then went onto to also read Simons book on the subject, Start With Why and his next book, Leaders Eat Last. 

They are both incredibly inspiring and I urge you to read them but the core message is simple, people are inspired by why you do the things that you do, not how or what you do.

Its such a simple message, but something also that is hard to quantify, most people know what they do and how they do it, but only a small number know why they do the things they do. I find this fascinating, that something so simple is so hard to discover, why do you do what you do?

### The Golden Circle

The Golden Circle is how Simon "codified" his message, starting from within the circle, Why drives behaviour, How and What are the tools to help achieve that behaviour. I'm not going to go into detail about how that behaviour is changed, Simon can do it so much better than I can, in the video above.

### Finding My Why

So after reading the books and watching the videos, it was time to try and discover my why, my reason for doing the things that I do.

After some thought, my Why is quite simple, the driving force behind the things I do is around my enjoyment of learning, finding better ways of doing things and sharing that knowledge with others to help them come up with innovative solutions to their own problems.

I just happen to do that through the use of the Microsoft cloud, be it Azure, Office 365, SharePoint Online, Flow etc and by writing posts on this blog I plan to share that knowledge.
