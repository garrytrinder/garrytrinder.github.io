The age old task of automating the provisioning of SharePoint site collections has always brought about new ways of doing things, we developers are always on the look out for anything that will make this process simpler and more automated than ever.

Earlier this year, I really wanted to get back into speaking at local user groups, so I put together this session and presented it to the Birmingham O365 User Group, it was really well recieved and the feedback I got was amazing.
 
Since then I have repeated this session at the Nottingham, Leeds and Glasgow User Groups, the latter of which was done remotely and also recorded. I hope you enjoy :)

> Please be aware that it was recently announced that the Azure Automation connector, along with all other Azure based connectors, will require a premium licence from 1st October 2019. For more information on the licence changes [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/powerapps-flow-licensing-faq#will-powerapps-and-microsoft-flow-use-rights-change-for-office-365-applications) 

Example runbooks and the presentation slides can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/garrytrinder/office365-azureautomation)

Finally, I'd like to thank all the organisers of the user groups that accepted my requests or asked me to present this session, without you giving up your time to run these events, it would not be possible üëèüèª
