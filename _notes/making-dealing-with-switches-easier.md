# Making dealing with switches easier

Switches default to going horizontally in the standard Power Automate view, this can become a nightmare to manage when you get more than a few cases added, constantly having to scroll left and right.

You can make working with switches easier by decreasing the size of your browser window, when the designer hits a specific breakpoint the switch cases stack vertically instead of horizontally.
