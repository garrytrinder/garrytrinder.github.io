## Source Control

A common feature of software that we use today and one of the most important features we look out for is the undo button to revert the last change we made, with some software being able to undo multiple changes to recover changes over a longer period of time.

We can undo mistakes that happened minutes ago, but what happens if we want to undo changes that happened over a longer period of time, what if we want to understand why changes were made, who made the changes or even roll back to a previous state?

This is where version control systems come in, they allow us to create repositories to store our files, track changes made over time and provide us with assurances that we can restore or view a version of a file at a given point in time, understand changes made to those files over time and who made them.

[git](https://git-scm.com) is the most popular and widely used version control system, it is a command line interface, open source and works on any operating system.
